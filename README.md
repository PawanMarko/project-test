# Tkinter's GUI Password Manager

A basic Tkinter GUI-based local password manager. It can search for saved entries, create random passwords, copy generated passwords to the clipboard, and save credentials to a JSON file.


## Features: - Create random passwords using symbols, numbers, and letters.
The generated password is automatically copied to the clipboard.
Save the password, email address, and website in `data.json`.
- To recover saved credentials, search by website.


## Prerequisites: Python 3.8+
- Tkinter (which comes with standard Python on Windows and macOS; you might need to install `python3-tk` on some Linux distributions.)
- `json` (a Python standard library component)

# (Only Linux, if Tkinter is absent.)
# sudo apt-get install python3-tk
